# Water Reservoir System Controller for Irrigation

## Overview
This project involves designing an Embedded System Controller for a terraced vineyard irrigation system that prioritizes energy efficiency. The controller manages a water reservoir, a pump, and a system of valves to distribute water to three irrigation zones at varying elevations. The system also monitors the reservoir's water depth and provides user control through a UART terminal interface.

This README outlines the key functionality, operation modes, and requirements for implementing and demonstrating the system.

## System Components

### Water Reservoir
- **Capacity**: 94,000 gallons  
- **Filled via**: Inlet pipe from an underground spring with a head of 40 feet.

### Pump and Motor
- **Function**: Moves water from the reservoir to irrigation zones.  
- **Control**: Controlled via a PWM signal for variable speeds.

### Zones
- **Zone 1**:
  - Elevation: 25 feet  
  - Water required: 50,000 gallons/day  
  - Minimum RPM: 70  
- **Zone 2**:
  - Elevation: 50 feet  
  - Water required: 30,000 gallons/day  
- **Zone 3**:
  - Elevation: 60 feet  
  - Water required: 14,000 gallons/day  

### Sensors
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures reservoir depth and displays percentage (0â€“99%).

### Servo Valve System
- **Function**: Directs water to one zone or inlet at a time.

### LED Indicators
- **Green LED**: Indicates operating mode:  
  - ON = RUN mode.  
  - Flashing = Setup Mode ready.  
- **RGB LED**: Displays specific colors for different pipeline operations:  
  - Purple: Inlet pipe  
  - Other colors: Zone pipelines  

### User Controls
- **UART Terminal**: Inputs configuration and displays system status.  
- **Potentiometer**: Allows manual control of motor speed in Run Mode if enabled.

## Operation Modes

### 1. Setup Mode
- **Entry**: Reset the MCU (Nucleo board).  
- **Green LED**: OFF during configuration.  
- **Pump**: Remains OFF.  

#### Tasks:
1. **Set Motor Speed PWM**  
   - For each connection (Inlet, Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3):  
     - Select one of the following PWM options:  
       - `0`: Manual control via potentiometer.  
       - `1`: 60% PWM.  
       - `2`: 80% PWM.  
       - `3`: 99% PWM.  

2. **Set Wall Clock Times**  
   - Input start and stop times for:  
     - Inlet pipe operation.  
     - Irrigation for each zone.  
   - **Ensure**: Times do not overlap (except where one stop time equals the next start time).  

3. **Demo Scaling**  
   - The 24-hour day is scaled to 2.4 real-time minutes.  
   - Each "hour" equals 6 seconds in real-time.  

4. **Transition to Run Mode**:  
   - Once configuration is complete, the system flashes the Green LED.  
   - Press the **Blue B1 Button** to enter Run Mode.

### 2. Run Mode
- **Green LED**: Remains ON during operation.  
- **Pump Operation**: Follows the sequence of wall clock times configured in Setup Mode.  

#### Tasks:
1. **Inlet Pipe Operation**  
   - Fill reservoir using the inlet pipe first.  
   - Stop filling when the reservoir reaches maximum depth.  

2. **Irrigation Sequence**  
   - Direct water to each zone in the configured order and time intervals.  
   - Adjust pump speed (RPM) based on the zone's head and selected PWM.  

3. **Monitor Reservoir Depth**  
   - Display water depth percentage on a seven-segment display.  
   - Stop the pump if the reservoir depth reaches 0%.  

4. **Terminal Updates**  
   - Display the following information at each wall clock update or special event:  
     ```
     Wall-Clock Time | Zone/Inlet | Motor Speed %PWM | Motor RPM | Reservoir Depth (%)
     ```

#### Special Events:
- **Reservoir Empty**:  
  - Stop the pump immediately.  
  - Indicate "RESERVOIR EMPTY" on the terminal.  
  - RGB LED cycles through RED, GREEN, BLUE.  
  - Green LED: OFF.  
  - System halts until a reset is performed.

## Key Features
- **Energy Efficiency**: Optimizes motor speed based on the head requirements of each zone.  
- **Safety**: Prevents pump operation when the reservoir is empty.  
- **Scalability**: Configurable wall clock scheduling and PWM settings allow testing of different scenarios.  
- **Visualization**: Real-time status updates via UART and seven-segment displays.
